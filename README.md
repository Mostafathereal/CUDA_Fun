# CUDA_Food
Learning the CUDNN library and how to develop in CUDA with what is essentially C++ but with added functions and annotations distinguishing them from the host code, plus annotations for distinguishing different types of data memory that exists on the GPU. NVCC (Nvidia CUDA Compiler) compiles the CUDA source files (.cu) containing the host code and device functions.

## convolution with CUDNN
in the CUDNN folder; performing convolution with 4 edge detecting kernals and combingin the out images (max of the 4 pixels) to find edges in image.
